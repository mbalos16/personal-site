                            Many third-world countries face significant challenges in e-waste management due to inadequate recycling methods. 
                            Annually, large amounts of e-waste are improperly disposed of in landfills and incinerators, often imported from more developed countries. 
                            Such practices pose serious risks to human, animal, and plant health.

                            The objective is to develop sustainable, safer e-waste management strategies suitable for diverse regions, thereby mitigating the environmental and health impacts of e-waste.

                                The goal of this discovery interview was to answer some of the questions that emerged during the earlier design phases. 
                            To ensure the proper users were interviewed, a screener has been created.
                            Also an interview script comprising some demographic questions and interview questions was created. 
                            The informed consent and Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) were created and presented and explained to users before the interviews. 
                            Five representative users from the target audience were interviewed presenting the results in the following section.
