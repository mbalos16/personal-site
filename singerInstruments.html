                        In this page I would like to share my incredible journey as a UX designer during my 6-month
                    internship
                    at Singer Instruments. It was an invaluable experience that allowed me to grow both
                    professionally
                    and personally. Here, I will highlight some key aspects of my internship, the projects I worked
                    on,
                    and the skills I developed along the way.

                            During my tenure as a UX designer intern at Singer Instruments, I had the privilege of working at
                        the
                        intersection of user experience design and biotechnology. This unique blend presented
                        captivating
                        challenges and fascinating opportunities to create meaningful experiences in the scientific
                        realm.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Being exposed to this field, I realized how much needs to be done to help scientists in their
                        day-to-day work and accelerate science. At Singer, I had the chance to work on projects that
                        directly impacted scientists and observe the need for improvement in their experience while
                        interacting with biotechnology. I also had the opportunity to work on a start-to-end project
                        such as
                        the Central Colony Zone of Inhibition project, which involved designing a user interface journey
                        for
                        analyzing inhibition areas in petri dishes with PIXL (Singer Instruments colony picker). This
                        project showcased the importance of user-centric design in enabling scientists to make informed
                        decisions and derive valuable insights from their research.

                            <br>
                            In biotechnology, it is essential to navigate complex technical terminology and jargon specific
                        to
                        the field. As a UX designer, I had to bridge the gap between scientists and technology by
                        translating their requirements and objectives into intuitive design solutions. By empathizing
                        with
                        users, conducting thorough user research, and iterating on designs based on feedback, I was able
                        to
                        create interfaces that catered to their unique needs and workflows.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Working in biotechnology also presented challenges in terms of data visualization and
                        simplifying
                        complex scientific processes. Through iterative prototyping and usability testing, I strove to
                        distill intricate scientific concepts into user-friendly interfaces that promoted effective data
                        analysis and interpretation.

                                During my time at Singer Instruments, I had the opportunity to work on the Central Colony
                            Zone of Inhibition project, a new feature created for the PIXL colony picker. I collaborated
                            in an Agile environment and delivered valuable insights to stakeholders. I honed my skills
                            in various software programs such as Adobe XD, Jira, Fibery, and Google Suite. Additionally,
                            I automated interview transcriptions, conducted heuristic evaluations, created prototypes,
                            and led user testing and A/B testing sessions. I analyzed questionnaire results and
                            generated actionable recommendations that were shared with the entire company.

                            My impact at Singer Instruments
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            As a UX designer at Singer Instruments, I had the privilege of making a significant impact
                        during my 6-month internship. By leveraging my skills and expertise, I contributed to improving
                        the user experience and driving positive outcomes for the company.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            One area where my impact was particularly felt was the Zone of Inhibition project. Through my
                        involvement, I played a crucial role in enhancing the service and integrating it with PIXL
                        technology. By conducting heuristic evaluations, leading user testing sessions, and analyzing
                        user feedback, I identified pain points and provided actionable recommendations that were
                        implemented to improve the overall user experience. Another notable achievement was the
                        automation
                        of interview transcriptions for the User Experience
                        team using the Whisper speech recognition AI model. This innovation significantly reduced the
                        time required for transcription, improving efficiency by 50% to 83%. By streamlining this
                        process, I enabled the UX team to focus more on analysis and insights generation, ultimately
                        delivering better outcomes for stakeholders. If you need something similar for your team please 
                        get in contact with me, I’m happy to share it with you.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Furthermore, my analysis of the PIXL questionnaire results provided tangible insights that were
                        shared with the entire company. These insights informed decision-making processes and helped
                        guide future directions for product improvement. By actively engaging with internal and external
                        scientists, I was able to understand their needs and translate them into actionable design
                        solutions.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Overall, my contributions as a UX designer had a direct impact on the company’s goals and
                        objectives. Through collaboration, research, and a user-centric approach, I drove positive
                        changes in the user experience, contributing to Singer Instruments’ success in the biotechnology
                        industry.
